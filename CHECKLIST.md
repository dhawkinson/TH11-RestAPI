## Build REST API with Express

## Project Instructions

To complete this project, follow the instructions below. If you get stuck, ask a question in the community.

1. [X] Set up a database connection.
    * [X] Use npm to install Mongoose.
    * [X] Using Mongoose, create a connection to your MongoDB database.
    * [X] Write a message to the console if there's an error connecting to the database.
    * [X] Write a message to the console once the connection has been successfully opened.

2. [X] Create your Mongoose schema and models. Your database schema should match the following requirements:
    * [X] User
        * [X] _id (ObjectId, auto-generated)
        * [X] fullName (String, required)
        * [X] emailAddress (String, required, must be unique and in correct format)
        * [X] password (String, required)
        * [X] tokens (Array of objects {access, token})
    * [X] Course
        * [X] _id (ObjectId, auto-generated)
        * [X] user (_id from the users collection)
        * [X] title (String, required)
        * [X] description (String, required)
        * [X] estimatedTime (String)
        * [X] materialsNeeded (String)
        * [X] steps (Array of objects that include stepNumber (Number), title (String, required) and description (String, required) properties)
        * [X] reviews (Array of ObjectId values, _id values from the reviews collection)
    * [X] Review
        * [X] _id (ObjectId, auto-generated)
        * [X] user (_id from the users collection)
        * [X] postedOn (Date, defaults to “now”)
        * [X] rating (Number, required, must fall between “1” and “5”)
        * [X] review (String)

    Mongoose validation gives you a rich set of tools to validate user data. See "http://www.mongoosejs.com/docs/validation.html" for more information.

3. [X] Seed your database with data.
    * We've provided you with seed data in JSON format (see the src/data/data.json file) to work with the mongoose-seeder npm package.
    * See "https://www.github.com/SamVerschueren/mongoose-seeder" for documentation on how to use mongoose-seeder.
    * Important: mongoose-seeder requires an open connection to the database to be available, so be sure to not call your database seed code until Mongoose has successfully opened a connection to the database.

4. [X] Create the user routes
    * [X] Set up the following routes (listed in the format HTTP VERB Route HTTP Status Code):
        * [X] GET /api/users 200 - Returns the currently authenticated user
        * [X] POST /api/users 201 - Creates a user, sets the Location header to "/", and returns no content

5. [X] Create the course routes
    * Set up the following routes (listed in the format HTTP VERB Route HTTP Status Code):
        * [X] GET /api/courses 200 - Returns the Course "_id" and "title" properties
        * [X] GET /api/course/:courseId 200 - Returns all Course properties and related documents for the provided course ID
                When returning a single course for the GET /api/courses/:courseId route, use Mongoose population to load the related user and reviews documents.
        * [X] POST /api/courses 201 - Creates a course, sets the Location header, and returns no content
        * [X] PUT /api/courses/:courseId 204 - Updates a course and returns no content
        * [X] POST /api/courses/:courseId/reviews 201 - Creates a review for the specified course ID, sets the Location header to the related course and returns no content

6. [X] Update any POST and PUT routes to return Mongoose validation errors.
        * Use the next function in each route to pass any Mongoose validation errors to Express’s global error handler
        * Send the Mongoose validation error with a400 status code to the user

7. [X] Update the User model to store the user's password as a hashed value.
        * For security reasons, we don't want to store the password property in the database as clear text.
        * Create a pre save hook on the user schema that uses the bcrypt npm package to hash the user's password.
        * See "https://www.github.com/ncb000gt/node.bcrypt.js/" for more information.

8. [X] Create an authentication method on the user model to return the user document based on their credentials
        * Create a static method on the user schema that takes an email, password, and callback
        * The method should attempt to get the user from the database that matches the email address given.
        * If a user was found for the provided email address, then check that user's password against the password given using bcrypt.
        * If they match, then return the user document that matched the email address
        * If they don't match or a user with the email given isn’t found, then pass an error object to the callback

9. [X] Set up permissions to require users to be signed in
        * Postman will set an Authorization header with each request when a user is signed in.
        * Add a middleware function that attempts to get the user credentials from Authorization header set on the request.
        * You can use the basic-auth npm package to parse the `Authorization' header into the user's credentials.
        * Use the authenticate static method you built on the user schema to check the credentials against the database
        * If the authenticate method returns the user, then set the user document on the request so that each following middleware function has access to it.
        * If the authenticate method returns an error, then pass it to the next function
        * Use this middleware in the following routes:
            * POST /api/courses
            * PUT /api/courses/:courseId
            * GET /api/users
            * POST /api/courses/:courseId/reviews

## Extra Credit

To get an "exceeds" rating, you can expand on the project in the following ways:

1. [X] Review model
        * Validation added to prevent a user from reviewing their own course
2. [X] User routes
        * Tests have been written for the following user stories:
            * When I make a request to the GET /api/users route with the correct credentials, the corresponding user document is returned (200)
            * When I make a request to the GET /api/users route with the invalid credentials, a 401 status error is returned
3. [X] Course routes
        * When returning a single course for the GET /api/courses/:courseId route, use Mongoose deep population to return only the fullName of the related user on the course model and each review returned with the course model.
        * Example user object returned: { "_id": "wiubfh3eiu23rh89hcwib", "fullName": "Sam Smith" }* See the Project Resources section for more information about deep population.
